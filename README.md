I've been too busy recently. I've neglected to upload GitHub's code, but it doesn't matter. I've finished my English exam. My grades meet the requirements of three schools, and it's not too bad. There is one target school. Anyway, I hope Sheffield University can offer me an offer. It's too hard to read computers. I really don't know how those people survived, but I think java development is still a less difficult journey. At least it's not as voluminous as Algorithm Engineers, and it won't be as leisurely as other posts, but it's really a collapsing way to do it. When I was reviewing PTE, I was very uncomfortable. I really couldn't review this thing. Although I didn't say that the results of my first exam were amazing, it was also standard, but there were still a lot of things to do later. The learning of framework was just beginning. I didn't even finish learning spring. There were still a lot of things to learn later, It's really hard to study abroad after studying. I just hope to find a job with a monthly salary of about 30000 to repay my hard study during this period. It's really ironic. I've never studied so seriously since I was a child. I never wanted to study abroad before. I was also extremely disgusted with programming before. I don't know why we finally live like we hate most. Alas, it's hard to say.
